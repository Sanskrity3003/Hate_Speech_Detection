# Deep Learning-Based Hope Speech Analysis  
### A Comparative Study of CNN, RNN, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM Models  

## Introduction  
This project explores the application of deep learning techniques to classify textual data into two sentiment categories: **Hope** and **Not-Hope**. Sentiment analysis, particularly the detection of positive sentiments like hope, is critical for mental health monitoring and social analysis.  

### Objective  
The main objective of this project is to compare the performance of four deep learning models:  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**  
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**  
- **Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)**  

The goal is to determine which model is most effective in identifying hopeful sentiments from textual data.

## Methodology  

### Data Preprocessing  
1. **Text Cleaning:** Removal of stop words, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase.  
2. **Tokenization and Padding:** Text is tokenized and converted to numerical indexes, followed by padding to maintain uniform sequence lengths.  

### Model Architectures  
1. **CNN:** Captures local patterns in text using convolutional and pooling layers.  
2. **RNN:** Processes input sequentially, maintaining a hidden state of prior words.  
3. **LSTM:** Enhances RNN by capturing long-term dependencies.  
4. **Bi-LSTM:** Processes data in both forward and backward directions to capture contextual information from both past and future words.  

### Model Training  
- Models were trained for **60 epochs** with a batch size of **32**.  
- Metrics used: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**  
- Training and validation datasets were used to evaluate model performance.

## Results  

### Accuracy and Loss  
| Model    | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy | Training Loss | Validation Loss |  
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|  
| CNN     | 99.32%            | 86.91%              | 0.0228       | 1.1948         |  
| RNN     | 96.83%            | 86.33%              | 0.1377       | 0.4503         |  
| LSTM    | 86.91%            | 88.87%              | 0.3039       | 0.3355         |  
| Bi-LSTM | 98.14%            | 86.72%              | 0.0558       | 0.7099         |  

### Performance Analysis  
- **CNN:** Highest training accuracy but prone to overfitting.  
- **RNN:** Balanced accuracy with moderate overfitting.  
- **LSTM:** Best validation accuracy, capturing long-term dependencies.  
- **Bi-LSTM:** Slightly lower validation accuracy, possibly due to model complexity.  

### Classification Report (F1-Score for Hope Class)  
| Model    | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |  
|---------|----------|-------|---------|  
| CNN     | 0.36     | 0.25  | 0.29    |  
| RNN     | 0.33     | 0.25  | 0.29    |  
| LSTM    | 0.43     | 0.05  | 0.10    |  
| Bi-LSTM | 0.33     | 0.21  | 0.26    |

## Challenges  
- **Class Imbalance:** The minority class (Hope) was challenging to classify accurately.  
- **Model Overfitting:** Particularly observed in CNN due to its focus on local features.  
- **Sequential Understanding:** RNN and LSTM models perform better in capturing context but struggle with imbalanced data.

## Future Enhancements  
1. **Class Balancing:** Use techniques like SMOTE for synthetic data generation.  
2. **Advanced Architectures:** Employ transformer models like BERT for better contextual understanding.  
3. **Improved Metrics:** Integrate metrics like **Cohen's Kappa** for a more balanced evaluation.
